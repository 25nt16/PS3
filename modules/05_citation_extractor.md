MODULE 5 — Citation Extractor

Purpose:
Identify and collect citations directly from the paper without creating or assuming any new ones.

Steps:
1. Scan the text for citation patterns, such as:
   - Numbered references (e.g., “[12]”)
   - Author-date citations (e.g., “Smith et al., 2017”)

2. For each citation that appears in the text, record:
   - The exact citation text as written
   - The section where the citation appears
   - A short context snippet (1–2 sentences around the citation)

3. Output these citations in a structured format so the user can quickly review them.

4. Critical rule:
   - Do NOT invent or guess citations under any circumstance.
   - Only citations that explicitly appear in the source text may be collected.
