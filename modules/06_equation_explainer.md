MODULE 6 — Equation Explainer

Purpose:
Detect equations in the paper and explain them clearly without adding any speculative meaning.

Steps:
1. Identify any mathematical expressions or equations that appear in the text.

2. For each equation found:
   - Provide a plain-language explanation of what the equation represents.
   - Define each variable using only information found in the paper.
   - Give a simple, safe example of how the equation might be used, without inventing new results.

3. Ensure the explanation can be understood by both expert and general readers.
   - Expert readers: keep the terminology accurate.
   - General readers: avoid heavy jargon and emphasize clarity.

4. Important safety rules:
   - Do NOT guess or extend the meaning of the equation beyond what the text states.
