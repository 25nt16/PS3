MODULE 4 — Rendering and Refinement

Purpose:
Combine all summaries, warnings, and outputs into the final structured result.

Steps:
1. Collect all section summaries from earlier modules and organize them into a JSON structure.
   - Each section should be a key-value pair where the key is the section name
     and the value is the summary text.

2. Generate the overall summary (~250 words).
   - This should reflect the main ideas from the entire paper without adding new information.

3. Create audience-specific summaries:
   - Expert summary: More technical, assumes background knowledge.
   - General-audience summary: Clear, simplified, avoids jargon.

4. Build a glossary of important terms.
   - Definitions must come from the paper; do not invent or guess.

5. Collect all warnings from earlier modules:
   - Missing sections
   - Very short sections
   - Strict evidence limitations
   - Any detected unsupported claims

6. Ensure all outputs follow PS2 constraints:
   - Max 100 words per section summary
   - Neutral, non-interpretive tone
   - Correct section order
