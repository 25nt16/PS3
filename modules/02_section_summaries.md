MODULE 2 — Section Summaries

Purpose:
Summarize each section of the paper according to the user’s preferences.

Steps:
1. Process each section in the order provided by the user.

2. Apply summary level rules:
   • Short:
       – 1–2 sentences
       – Must be ≤ 100 words
       – Capture only the main idea of the section

   • Detailed:
       – One short paragraph
       – Plus 2–3 bullet points highlighting key details
       – Total content (paragraph + bullets) still ≤ 100 words

3. Use only the supplied text for each section; do not rely on outside knowledge or assumptions.

4. Add warnings if:
   - The section is incomplete.
   - The section is too short to summarize meaningfully.
   - The section appears to contain unsupported claims.

5. Store each completed section summary in the structured JSON that will be assembled later.
