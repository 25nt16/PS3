# Research Paper Summarizer — CISC101 Group 144

This repository contains our implementation for PS3, where we design a modular system prompt and internal architecture for a Research Paper Summarizer. The project is based on our PS2 specification.

## Project Overview
The goal of the summarizer is to:
- summarize research papers clearly and accurately
- avoid hallucinations
- stay completely grounded in the text provided
- provide summaries for different audiences
- include safety checks like strict evidence handling

The system is designed using six modules plus a main system prompt.
